# Generating tweets with recurrent networks

This repository is my first test for generating text (and tweets) with deep recurrent networks. Most of the code here is based on [this tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/sequences/text_generation) and the classic article [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).

The repository is currently under construction, so don't be surprised if part of the documentation is missing or the code is poorly written. Updates are being made as time allows, and suggestions are welcome :).
