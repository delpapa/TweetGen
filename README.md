# Generating text and tweets with recurrent networks

This repository is my first test for generating text (and tweets) with deep recurrent networks. Most of the code here is based on [this tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/sequences/text_generation) and the classic article [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).

The repository is currently under construction, so don't be surprised if part of the documentation is missing or the code is poorly written. Updates are being made as time allows :).
